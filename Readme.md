Forked from eamondo2 who forked from onedr0p, working to port to Radarr for movie support. Will hopefully add support for use in a group chat. 

# telegram-radarr-bot

Bot which lets you or others add series to [Radarr](https://radarr.video/) via the messaging service [Telegram](https://telegram.org/).

This uses a node:alpine base, so it will work on both x86 and arm.  Raspberry pi works wonderfully.

Contact [@BotFather](http://telegram.me/BotFather) on Telegram to create and get a bot token.

Men in Black follows the exploits of agents Kay and Jay, members of a top-secret organization established to monitor and police alien activity on Earth. The two Men in Black find themselves in the middle of the deadly plot by an intergalactic terrorist who has arrived on Earth to assassinate two ambassadors from opposing galaxies. In order to prevent worlds from colliding, the MiB must track down the terrorist and prevent the destruction of Earth. It's just another typical day for the Men in Black.

### Notifications - Not ported yet
### As Radarr has built in telegram notification settings, I don't feel it is necessary to fix this. It currently does not work
Radarr can be setup to send notifications to a user or a group chat when new content is added.  

* In Radarr go to `Settings` > `Connect` > `+` > `Custom Script`
* In the Name field enter `Telegram`
* In the Path field enter the full path to your node.js installation i.e. `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`
* In the Arguments field enter the full path to `radarr_notify.js` i.e `C:\bots\telegram-radarr-bot\radarr_notify.js`
* Start the bot by running `node radarr.js`
* Open a new chat or group chat with the bot and type `/cid` 
* Note the Chat ID
* Open `config.json` and enter the Chat ID next to `notifyId`
* Restart the bot
* The specified chat will now begin receiving notifications for newly added content


### Additional commands
* `/upcoming` shows upcoming movies, has a day parameter, defaults to 3 days
* `/library` search Radarr library for existing movies
* `/help` show available commands
* `/clear` clear all previous commands and cache

### Admin commands
* `/wanted` search all missing/wanted movies
* `/rss` perform an RSS Sync
* `/refresh` refreshes all movies
* `/users` list users
* `/revoke` revoke user from bot
* `/unrevoke` un-revoke user from bot
* `/cid` gets current chat id

## Docker
Alternatively you may use Docker to start the bot
```
docker run --name telegram-radarr-bot \
  -e TELEGRAM_BOTTOKEN=
  -e BOT_PASSWORD=
  -e BOT_OWNER=
  -e BOT_NOTIFYID=
